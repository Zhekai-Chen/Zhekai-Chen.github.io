## About Me

I am an undergraduate student in the Computer Science and Technology program at Zhejiang University, expected to graduate in 2025. In 2023, I joined the State Key Lab of CAD&CG, where I conducted research on generative models under the mentorship of Professors [Chunhua Shen](https://cshen.github.io/) and [Hao Chen](https://stan-haochen.github.io/). Currently, I am working as a research intern in Professor [Tong Zhang](https://tongzhang-ml.org/)'s group at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).

My primary research interest lies in generative models, particularly in how these models can simplify complex tasks and enhance creativity. For example, video generation models can lower the learning curve for software like After Effects, enabling users to focus more on creative expression. I am also interested in Multimodal Language Learning Models (MLLM), which aim to improve the interaction between humans and AI.

**I am seeking PhD and MPhil opportunities for Fall 2025. If you are interested, please do not hesitate to contact me directly.**
